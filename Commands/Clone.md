# git clone

Cloning a repository is the act of creating a new directory and an associated copy of the remote repository. It will create all the history and tracking and commits.


It will also be associated with the remote, meaning you can use the `git pull` command to pull updated info from the original repository.

It can be done with the `git clone` command as seen here:

```
git clone https://github.com/ElevenfiftyAcademy/
```
